This structure is due to the presence of the 2Pig resonant state which manifests itself in total, elastic and vibrational excitation cross sections; different TCS measurements agree on the position and height of the peaks; the resonant structure in N2 , in particular as measured in Kennerly, R.E.: Phys. Rev. A 21 (1980) 1876, is the most frequently used as standard in the energy scale calibration for low-energy electron scattering.	\N	\N

Brunger determined their recommended values considering five sets of beam measurementsthe cross section; the data has a sharp peak in the vicinity of the threshold identified with a core-excited shape resonance; two groups have determined the resonant cross section with the use of direct detection of the molecule in the metastable E state;  the magnitudes of the two sets of cross section differ significantly from one another; by using a trochoidal electron spectrometer, Poparich determined the absolute values of the cross section at 11.94 and 12.14 eV, and this measurement supported one set of the cross section against the other	0.4	0.4

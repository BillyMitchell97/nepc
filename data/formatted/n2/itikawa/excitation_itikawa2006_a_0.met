R-matrix method theoretical cross sections have been referred to for the detailed structure near threshold; oherwise a weighted average of the experimental cross sections has been taken with a polynomial least square fit to the energy dependence of the individual set of the cross sections; thus the estimated uncertainty indicates the degree of the concurrence of the individual experimental results.	0.4	0.4

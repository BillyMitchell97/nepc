The N(2p)  concentration and altitude distribution from 110 to 195 km was determined from measurements of the intensity of the NI(4S - 2p;lambda=3466 Angstrom) doublet. The optical data were obtained by a filtered photometer onboard a  Taurus-Orion sounding rocket (33.001 UA) that was launched into a bright auroral arc. Complementary measurements of the  intensity of the (0, 0) first negative band of N2+[lambda=3914 Angstrom] and of the flux and energy distribution of the precipitating electrons in the  0-500 eV energy range were also made.  This channel is one of two N2 singlet state predissociation pathways. We make the assumption that 15% of N2 singlet states dissociate into a N(2D) pair. Since the values in Table 3 are specific cross sections, the cross sections for this process are computed as 26% of Table 3 column [2].	\N	\N

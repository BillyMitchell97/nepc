423	N2	dissociation	1.0	0.0001	zipf1980	N2	\N	N	N	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	in situ study of the excitation and collisional deactivation of N(2p) atoms in an IBC II + aurora. The N(2p)  concentration and altitude distribution from 110 to 195 km was determined from measurements of the intensity of the NI(4S - 2p;lambda=3466 Angstrom) doublet. The optical data were obtained by a filtered photometer onboard a  Taurus-Orion sounding rocket (33.001 UA) that was launched into a bright auroral arc. Complementary measurements of the  intensity of the (0, 0) first negative band of N2+[lambda=3914 Angstrom] and of the flux and energy distribution of the precipitating electrons in the  0-500 eV energy range were also made.  Values determined by adding columns [2] and [5] from Table 3	-1	-1

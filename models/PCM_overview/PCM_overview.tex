\section{Introduction}

Recommended cross sections are provided, and similar criteria to
ref~\cite{itikawa2006} are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item experimental data are preferred to theoretical results, but in some cases, elaborate calculations
provide fine details which cannot be experimentally obtained;
\item agreement between independent experimental measurements of the same cross section is generally
taken as an endorsement of the accuracy of the measured data, with preference for consistency of
results taken by different techniques; and
\item cases where only a single set of data is available for a given cross section are noted
\end{itemize}

For the designation of the electronic energy levels of atoms and diatomic
molecules the spectroscopic notation is used:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Atom: $nl^w\; {}^{2S+l}L_j$\\
\item Diatomic molecule: $nl^w\; {}^{2S+l}\Lambda_\Omega$
\end{itemize}
 
with the main quantum number $n$, the angular momentum $l$, the number of electrons
in the shell $w$, the resulting spin $S$, the multiplicity $2S + 1$, the resulting angular
momentum $L$ ($L = 0, 1, 2,...$ corresponding to energy levels indicating the $S, P, D,. . .$ 
states), the total angular momentum $J = L+S$ which represents the  $LS$ coupling in
the case of light atoms, and in the case of diatomic molecules  $\Omega =\Lambda + \sum_{g,u}^{+,-}$ represents
the projection of the corresponding momentum vectors onto the internuclear axis in
Greek letters with the addition + or – as well as $g$ or $u$ describing the symmetry
properties of the electronic wave function. The convention for the state assignment in
molecules are $X$ for the ground state, $A, B,\ldots$ for excited states of the same multiplicity
as the ground state $X$, and $a, b,\ldots$ for excited states of different multiplicity as $X$.

Tables and figures to include in each PCM:

\begin{itemize}
\item permitted radiative transitions in neutral atoms
\item potential energy curves
\item metastable energy levels
\item electron impact ionization thresholds
\item dissociative electron attachment thresholds
\end{itemize}

				abstract = { A new gas–chemistry model is presented to treat the breakdown of a nitrogen gas with pressures on the order of 1 Torr from intense electron beams with current densities on the order of 10 kA/cm2 and pulse durations on the order of 100 ns. For these parameter regimes, the gas transitions from a weakly ionized molecular state to a strongly ionized atomic state on the time scale of the beam pulse. The model is coupled to a 0D–circuit model using the rigid–beam approximation that can be driven by specifying the time and spatial profiles of the beam pulse. Simulation results are in good agreement with experimental measurements of the line–integrated electron density from experiments done using the Gamble II generator at the Naval Research Laboratory. It is found that the species are mostly in the ground and metastable states during the atomic phase, but that ionization proceeds predominantly through thermal ionization of optically allowed states with excitation energies close to the ionization limit. }

	abstract = {The R-matrix method is used to perform high-level calculations of electron collisions with beryllium mono-hydride at its equilibrium geometry with a particular emphasis on electron impact electronic excitation. Several target and scattering models are considered. The calculations were performed using (1) the UKRMol suite which relies on the use of Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) to represent the continuum and (2) using the new UKRMol+ suite which allows the inclusion of B-spline type orbitals in the basis for the continuum. The final close-coupling scattering models used the UKRMol+ code and a frozen core, valence full configuration interaction, method based on a diffuse GTO atomic basis set. The calculated electronic properties of the molecule are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations. The use of the UKRMol+ suite proved critical since it allowed the use of a large R-matrix sphere (35 Bohr), necessary to contain the diffuse electronic states of the molecule. The corresponding calculations using UKRMol are not possible due to numerical problems associated with the combination of GTO-only continuum and a large R-matrix sphere. This work provides the first demonstration of the utility and numerical stability of the new UKRMol+ code. The inelastic cross sections obtained here present a significant improvement over the results of earlier studies on BeH.}

abstract = "The R-matrix method is an embedding procedure which is based on the division of space into an inner region where the physics is complicated and an outer region for which greatly simplified equations can be solved. The method developed out of nuclear physics, where the effects of the inner region were simply parametrized, into atomic and molecular physics, where the full problem can be formulated and hopefully solved ab initio. In atomic physics R-matrix based procedures are the method of choice for the ab initio calculation of electron collision parameters. There has been a number of R-matrix procedures developed to treat the low-energy electron–molecule collision problem or particular aspects of this problem. These methods have been extended to both positron physics and the R-matrix treatment of vibrational motion. The physical basis of the R-matrix method as well as its theoretical formulation are presented. Various electron scattering models within an R-matrix formulation including static exchange, static exchange plus polarization and close coupling are described with reference to various computational implementations of the method; these are compared to similar models used within other scattering methods. The need for a balanced treatment of the target and continuum wave functions is emphasised. Extensions of close-coupling based models into the intermediate energy regime using pseudo-states is discussed, as is the adaptation of R-matrix methods to problems involving photons. The numerical realisation of the R-matrix method is based on the adaptation of quantum chemistry codes in the inner region and asymptotic electron–atom scattering programs in the outer region. Use of bound state codes in scattering calculations raises issues involving continuum basis sets, appropriate orbitals, integral evaluation, orthogonalization, Hamiltonian construction and diagonalization which need to be addressed. The algorithms developed to resolve these issues are described as are ones associated with the outer region where methods to characterize resonances have received particular attention. Results from a few illustrative calculations are discussed: (i) electron collisions with polar systems with water as an example; (ii) electron collisions with molecular ions focusing on H3+; (iii) electron collisions with organic species such as methane and uracil and (iv) positron–molecule collisions. Finally some outstanding issues that need to be addressed are mentioned."

NEPC, standing for NRL Evaluated Plasma Chemistry, is a project involving the building of a database of evaluated electron-scattering cross-sections from various sources as well as tools to access and visualize the data. Data can be accessed, raw and formatted, through the "data" directory, while other directories of the project are used for builing and accessing the database. For more information on how the project is organized, please see the [Wiki](http://predator.nrl.navy.mil/padamson/nepc/wikis/home). This database is designed for anyone interested in plasma chemistry with a background in physics at graduate level.
